## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".
Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
```
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]
print(" \(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")

```
## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`
```
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
var newWesternStates = [String]()
let illinois = "Illinois"
let kansas = "Kansas"

for state in westernStates {
    if state != illinois && state != kansas {
        newWesternStates.append(state)
    }
}
print(newWesternStates)

```
## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`
```
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]
var hawaii = "Hawaii"
for state in moreStates {
    if state == hawaii {
        print("\(state) : is NOT in the continental United States \n")
    } else {
        print("\(state) : is in the continental United States \n")
    }
}
```
## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`
```
let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
let trimmedStr = myString.components(separatedBy: .whitespacesAndNewlines).joined()
print(trimmedStr)
print("There are \(trimmedStr.count) non-whitespace characters in `myString`")
```
Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`
```
let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]

var character = 0
for sentence in myFavoriteQuotes {
    for space in sentence {
        if String(space) != " " {
            character += 1
        }
    }
    print("\"\(sentence)\" has \(character) non-whitespace characters.")
    character = 0
}
```
## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]

var basket = [String]()

for (i, g) in garden.enumerated() {
if g == "ðŸŒ·" {
basket.append(g)
garden[i] = "dirt"
}
}
print("\(basket) = \(basket.count) ")
print(garden)
```
## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`
```
var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]
print(battingLineup)

//add "Suzuki" to the end of the lineup
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
print(battingLineup)

//change "Jeter" to "Tejada"
if let i = battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Jeter") {
battingLineup[i] = "Tejada"
}
print(battingLineup)

//change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
if let i = battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Thomas") {
battingLineup[i] = "Guerrero"
}
print(battingLineup)

//Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead
if let i = battingLineup.firstIndex(of: "Rodriguez") {
battingLineup[i] = "Reyes"
}
battingLineup[0] = "Rodriguez"
print("Final Batting Line Up = \(battingLineup)")
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)
```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```
Ex.1

```swift
var numbersOne = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
let target = 32
//true

var value = false
for n in numbersOne {
if n == target {
value = true
break
}
}
print(value)
```
Ex. 2

```swift
var numbersTwo = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]
let target = 3
//false

var value = false
for n in numbersTwo {
if n == target {
value = true
break
}
}
print(value)
```
## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var maxVal = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if maxVal < number {
maxVal = number
}
}

print(maxVal)
```

## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
'let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}'

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.

let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var minVal = arrayOfNumbers[0]
for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if minVal > number {
minVal = number
}
}
print(minVal)
```
## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`
```
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]
var oddNumbers = ""

for odd in secondListOfNumbers where odd % 2 == 1 {
oddNumbers += "\(odd) "
}
print(oddNumbers)
```
## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]

var sumOfthirdListOfNumbers = 0

for n in thirdListOfNumbers {
sumOfthirdListOfNumbers += n
}
print(sumOfthirdListOfNumbers)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sumOfthirdListOfEvenNumbers = 0
for even in thirdListOfNumbers where even % 2 == 0 {
sumOfthirdListOfEvenNumbers += even
}
print(sumOfthirdListOfEvenNumbers)
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()

for i in listOne{
if listTwo.contains(i) == true {
sharedElements.append(i)
}
}

print("There are \(sharedElements.count) shared elements --> \(sharedElements)")
```
## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []

for i in dupeFriendlyList where noDupeList.contains(i) != true{
noDupeList.append(i)
}

print(noDupeList)
```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`
```
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

var secondSmallestNumber = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()[1]
print(secondSmallestNumber)
```
## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```
var sum = 0
for i in 1..<1000 where i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
sum += i
}

print(sum)
```
## Question 17

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.

```swift

print(moreThanTwice)
```
